Important notes:
1. The gtf annotation file and .bam (RNA seq) files used to create the example plots are not included in this repository, so please reference your files of choice as needed
2. The code uses the maxentpy library, which requires a MacOS or Linux machine to run (potential work around with WSL on Windows)
