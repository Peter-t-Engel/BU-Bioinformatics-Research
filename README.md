This tool can find 5' and 3' splice site logos and the frequency of all splice site strengths from GTF annotation data. Additionally, it provides a plot for the correlation between splice site strengths and their usage/count from RNA-seq (.bam) data.

Important notes:
1. The GTF annotation and .bam files used to create the example plots are not included in this repository, so please reference your files of choice as needed
2. The code uses the maxentpy library, which requires a MacOS or Linux machine to run (potential work around with WSL on Windows)
